# MSE485-Monte-Carlo-Battery-Sim-
MSE 485 Final Project: simulating Lithium based battery 
Purpose: simulate charging process using monte carlo method

General structure:

TWO BOXES:  one for anode and one for cathode
    universal electric field and drives lithium ions in one direction.
    Lithium metal oxide and lithium carbon: fixed atoms
    No implementation of separator.

Notable points: stops lithium from flowing out

Calculate: 
    charging speed: how many amperes we are storing. 
    Diffusion coefficient. 
    Charging temperature, 
    structure factor, 
    Effect of different separator material

To do: 
    Figure out the properties of lithium carbon and lithium metal oxide
    Coulombic force
    Lattice structure 
    Treating molecule as oversized atom
